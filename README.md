Learning Objectives:
1. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to understand Data.
2. Perform data preprocessing (cleaning, feature encoding etc).
3. Understand how to select features for model building.
4. Determine appropriate metrics to evaluate machine learning models.
5. Train machine learning models.
6. Tune model hyperparameters.
7. Evaluate machine learning models and perform comparative study.
8. Determine a model for deployment.
2. Assignment Goal:
You have been hired as a data scientist for ABC ecommerce company. Following is the
conversation between you and your manager during a 1:1 meeting.
Recently our company is facing an issue due to unusual purchase orders.
The company wants to deploy an AI system to capture these unusual purchases. Can you help
us with that?
If I can get some data, I will be able to build such a system.
I can ask Alice to share the transaction data with you. However, to maintain customer privacy,
many data fields are encoded. These fields have a prefix PCA along with some other fields in
the dataset.
Do we have a column that marks which of these are suspicious?
There is a column called Type_of_Transaction that marks each transaction as Normal or
Unusual.
I will use python and create several models and report back the best model.That sounds great. I will be eagerly waiting to see the results. Please create a presentation with
your finding and results. Don’t forget to comment your code.
3. Tasks:
1. Read the data and perform EDA. Determine a metrics for model evaluation.
2. Based on the EDA, clean the data and perform encoding for the columns (e.g. converting
categories to numbers, or multiple columns )
3. Select the important features for your model.
4. Build and train the following machine learning models (70% of the overall data):
a. Decision Tree
b. Logistic Regression
c. Naïve Bayes
5. Evaluate the models (30% of the overall data not used in training) and determine the metrics of
interest.
